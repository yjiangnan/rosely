## Examples

This folder contains iPython notebooks for examples of Rosely data analysis. The notebooks may take a few seconds to open, be patient.

### RNA-seq data analysis with paired samples
For a normal RNA-seq analysis (paired), including identification of differential gene expression, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis, see file [human_classical_vs_nonclassical_monocyte_study_RNA-seq_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/yjiangnan/rosely/blob/master/examples/human_classical_vs_nonclassical_monocyte_study_RNA-seq_analysis.ipynb). It also shows how neutrality-controlled *p*-values are used for false discovery control. 

### RNA-seq data analysis with unpaired samples
For a normal RNA-seq analysis (unpaired), including identification of differential gene expression, Gene Ontology and KEGG pathway analysis, see file [Hematopoietic_stem_cells.RNA-seq.ipynb](https://github.com/yjiangnan/rosely/blob/master/examples/Hematopoietic_stem_cells.RNA-seq.ipynb). It also shows how Rosely can identify experimental design problems even the researchers themselves failed to recognize.
